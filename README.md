# Codefest-Synergy

This project consists of a mark predictor using a Linear Regression algorithm and a note taking app that has features such as speech recognition easy to use and intuitve controls

Our project idea is to make a note-taking app, this app is special because it has many features that a modern note-taking app has along with many more features. This is done by incorporating a variety of APIs which will then increase the functionality of our app.

Our app idea revolutionises modern day note-taking given the circumstances of the global pandemic. It includes structure and revision formats which helps the target demographic to revise and connect the dots between their studies. This particular app includes features like actice recall, highlight text, To-do list and much more. Additionally the application is aesthetically pleasing and user friendly.

For our mark predictor we are using an algorithm that is based off of linear graphs and the slope concept or the equation more famously known as y = mx + b. Where m = slope and b = y-intercept.

Let's say we have a linear graph with a slope of 3/2 and a y-intercept of 5 we will get an equation of 
y = 3x/2 + 5

And if we want a certain y value for a certain x value such as x = 5 y = ? we can input x into the equation and we can write this as an function: f(x) = 3x/2 + 5

f(5) = 3(5) / 2 + 5
f(5) = 7.5 + 2
f(5) = 9.5

Hence, the y = 9.5 when x = 5

It also includes a simple to-do list that will help you in managing your tasks.
